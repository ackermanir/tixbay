Feature: Dashboard and Recommendations for Signed in User

  As a tix bay area user
  So that I can find shows that match my interests
  I want to see a personalized recommendation page when I am signed in

Background: shows have been added to database

  Given the database has been setup from xml
  And I am on the home page
  And the date is set to 2012
 
Scenario: personal recommendations page
  Given I am already logged in
  And I already filled out the recommendations form
  And I am on the recommendation page
  Then I should see "recently viewed"
  And I should only see 5 recents
  And I should see "favorites"
  And I should only see 5 favorites
