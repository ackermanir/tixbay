Feature: Basic Front Page

  As a tix bay area user
  So that I can effectively nagivate the website to view shows and buy tickets
  I want to see a home page with relevant links and information

Background: shows have been added to database

  Given the following shows exist:
    | title                   | image_url      | summary       | link                       | id      |     
    | The Greatest Show       | image.jpg      | fake summary  | http://www.goldstar.com/   |  1      |
    | Another Show            | image.jpg      | fake summary  | http://www.goldstar.com/   |  2      |
    | Lala Show               | image.jpg      | fake summary  | http://www.goldstar.com/   |  3      |
    | What Show               | image.jpg      | fake summary  | http://www.goldstar.com/   |  4      |

  Given the following categories exist:
    | name                    | id  | 
    | Theater                 | 1   | 
    | Jazz                    | 2   | 
    | Film                    | 3   | 

  And there are category and show associations
  And I am on the home page
